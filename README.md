# Bome-Translator-Presets
Collection of Bome Midi Translator Presets

Originally I purchased the Behringer CMD PL-1 Midi controller so I could use it with SDR-Console V2. It was a cheap way of having
a large know (Jog Wheel) for tuning a radio.

Using Bome Midi Translator http://www.bome.com I can also use the CMD PL-1 to control almost any other piece of software or use
software to control the LEDs on the Midi controller.

This collection of Bome Midi Translator presets are what I have created for various bits of software. Some are a work in progress 
while others are complete. These presets can be altered using Bome Midi Translator to work with any Midi controller, including virtual ones.
